Meet **Merman** - your go-to scratchpad for instant visual feedback!\n\n## What is Merman?\n\nMerman is a simple, powerful utility page that lets you paste and preview Markdown and Mermaid diagrams in real-time. No need to generate a full blog post just to see if your diagram syntax is correct!\n\n**Access it here:** [Open Merman Scratchpad](../merman.html)\n\n---\n\n## Why You Need This\n\n### Quick Testing\n\nBefore adding content to your blog posts, use Merman to:\n\n- ✅ Test Mermaid diagram syntax\n- ✅ Preview markdown formatting\n- ✅ Check code block styling\n- ✅ Experiment with table layouts\n- ✅ Verify blockquote appearance\n\n### Real-Time Preview\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Paste Markdown] --> B[See Preview]\n    B --> C{Looks Good?}\n    C -->|Yes| D[Copy to Blog Post]\n    C -->|No| E[Edit & Retry]\n    E --> B\n    D --> F[Generate Post]\n```\n\n### Auto-Save Feature\n\nYour work is automatically saved to browser localStorage - come back later and it's still there!\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n### Split-Pane Interface\n\n- **Left Pane:** Editor where you type/paste markdown\n- **Right Pane:** Live preview of rendered content\n- **Draggable Splitter:** Adjust pane sizes to your preference\n\n### Smart Mermaid Detection\n\nPaste a raw Mermaid diagram and it automatically wraps it in code fences:\n\n**You paste:**\n```\ngraph TD\n    A --> B\n```\n\n**Merman wraps it:**\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A --> B\n```\n\n**You see:** Beautiful rendered diagram!\n\n### Auto-Save to Browser\n\nLeave and come back - your content is still there! Uses localStorage to persist your work.\n\n---\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### 1. Testing Diagram Syntax\n\nWhen creating complex diagrams:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    You->>Merman: Paste diagram\n    Merman->>Browser: Render preview\n    Browser->>You: See result instantly\n    You->>You: Fix errors\n    You->>Blog: Copy working diagram\n```\n\n### 2. Formatting Tables\n\nPreview table layouts before adding to posts:\n\n| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Data | Data | Data |\n| Test | Preview | Perfect! |\n\n### 3. Testing Code Blocks\n\nSee how code appears:\n\n```python\ndef test_formatting():\n    \"\"\"Check if this looks good\"\"\"\n    return \"Perfect!\"\n```\n\n### 4. Quick Notes\n\nUse it as a scratchpad for ideas and notes that you might turn into blog posts later.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Basic Workflow\n\n1. **Open Merman:** Click the button on the blog index or visit `merman.html`\n2. **Paste/Type:** Add your markdown or Mermaid syntax\n3. **Preview:** See the rendered output instantly\n4. **Copy:** When it looks good, copy to your actual blog post\n\n### Example Session\n\n```markdown\n# Testing My Diagram\n\nLet me see if this works:\n\n\\`\\`\\`mermaid\ngraph TD\n    Start --> Middle\n    Middle --> End\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nLooks good! Now I'll add it to my blog post.\n```\n\n### Keyboard Tips\n\n- **Ctrl/Cmd + A:** Select all\n- **Ctrl/Cmd + C:** Copy selected text\n- **Tab:** Insert tab (for code indentation)\n\n---\n\n## Behind the Scenes\n\nMerman uses the same technology as your blog posts:\n\n- **Marked.js** - Markdown parsing\n- **Mermaid.js** - Diagram rendering\n- **localStorage** - Auto-save feature\n- **Same CSS** - Consistent styling with blog\n\nThis means what you see in Merman is **exactly** what you'll see in your blog posts!\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n### 1. Test Before Publishing\n\nAlways test complex diagrams in Merman first. It's faster than regenerating blog posts repeatedly.\n\n### 2. Use as Template Builder\n\nCreate diagram templates in Merman, then copy them to multiple posts.\n\n### 3. Share Diagrams\n\nNeed to share a diagram with someone? Create it in Merman, take a screenshot!\n\n### 4. Learning Tool\n\nExperimenting with Mermaid? Use Merman to learn syntax without affecting your blog.\n\n### 5.

We're grateful to the 37signals team for their vision of beautiful, opinionated Linux environments.\n\nUbuntu is powerful, flexible, and free. But it has a reputation: too complex, too ugly, too much work to set up. [**Bentobox**](https://github.com/languageseed/bentobox) fixes that.\n\n> \"I made BentoBox to organize all of my build scripts and customization, and I find it useful—it saves me a lot of time. I'm not trying to build a company, I'm just sharing my knowledge and code in case it helps others.\" — Language Seed\n\nIt's a **one-command Ubuntu setup** that gives you a beautiful, fully-configured desktop in 30 minutes—whether you're a developer who needs to rebuild environments quickly, an everyday user looking for a Windows/Mac alternative, or someone who wants Linux as their primary OS while keeping Windows available when needed.\n\n## What is Bentobox?\n\nBentobox is a thoughtfully curated Ubuntu setup (forked from [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub)) that **eliminates rebuild friction** by streamlining dozens of Ubuntu customizations, configurations, package installations, and container deployments into a single automated process.\n\nThe name reflects our philosophy: like a Japanese bento box, we've carefully selected quality tools over quantity, each serving a specific purpose, arranged thoughtfully in a beautiful container.\n\n\u003Ccarousel>\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-1.png|Bentobox Desktop Interface|Beautiful curated Ubuntu desktop with modern wallpapers;\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-2.png|GUI Installer|Intuitive desktop installer for selecting applications and tools;\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-3.png|Theme Selection|Choose from multiple professionally curated themes;\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-4.png|Docker Integration|Portainer and OpenWebUI for container and AI management;\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-5.png|Development Environment|Modern editors and development tools ready to use\n\u003C/carousel>\n\n## 🎯 Who Is This For?\n\nBentobox solves different problems for different people:\n\n### For Everyday Users: The Windows/Mac Alternative\n\n**Tired of Windows but intimidated by Linux?** Bentobox is Ubuntu made beautiful and approachable.\n\n**Perfect if you:**\n- Want to escape Windows bloat, telemetry, and forced updates\n- Can't afford a Mac or don't want vendor lock-in\n- Need a computer that just works and looks beautiful\n- Don't want to spend days learning terminal commands\n\n**You get:** Chrome, VLC media player, Obsidian for notes, LibreOffice, and a beautiful desktop with 60+ professional wallpapers. No technical knowledge required—the GUI installer walks you through everything.\n\n### For Developers: Eliminate Rebuild Friction\n\n**Tired of spending 2-3 days rebuilding dev environments?** Bentobox reduces it to 30 minutes.\n\n**Perfect if you:**\n- Need to rebuild/restore environments frequently\n- Want consistent setups across multiple machines\n- Value container-first development workflows\n- Need AI integration (OpenWebUI, optional Ollama)\n- Want to eliminate the \"fresh install tax\"\n\n**You get:** Docker + Portainer for visual container management, OpenWebUI for AI workflows, modern editors (VS Code, Neovim, Zed), and your choice of programming languages—all pre-configured and ready to use.\n\n### For Windows Migrants: Your Exit Strategy\n\n**Want Linux as your primary OS but still need Windows occasionally?**\n\n**Perfect if you:**\n- Want Linux benefits (privacy, control, performance) as your daily driver\n- Need Windows for specific apps (Adobe, gaming, specialized tools)\n- Don't want to commit 100% to Linux immediately\n- Prefer gradual migration with a safety net\n\n**You get:** Linux as your primary OS with optional **WinBoat** integration for running Windows apps when needed—or simply dual boot for gaming and Windows-exclusive software.\n\n## 🎮 What About Gaming?\n\n**Let's be honest:** If gaming is important to you, Linux has limitations. Some games don't work (anti-cheat issues), and performance can vary.\n\n**Our Recommendation: Dual Boot**\n\nMany Bentobox users run dual boot setups:\n- **Linux (Bentobox)** for development, work, browsing, and productivity\n- **Windows** for gaming, Adobe Creative Suite, and Windows-only apps\n\n**Best of both worlds, zero compromises.** Install Windows first, then Ubuntu + Bentobox on the remaining space.
