Upload an image and instantly get 11 distinct color schemes ready to use in your design projects.\n\n### 🎨 The 11 Palette Variations\n\nEach image generates these unique palettes:\n\n1. **Extracted Colors** - Original dominant colors from the image (k-means clustering)\n2. **Soft Pastels** - Gentle, muted version (↑ lightness, ↓ chroma)\n3. **Complementary** - Opposite colors (inverted lightness, +180° hue)\n4. **Vibrant Bold** - Highly saturated, punchy colors (↑↑ chroma)\n5. **Highlighter Neon** - Maximum possible chroma at optimal lightness (L=0.8)\n6. **Monochrome** - Grayscale version (chroma = 0)\n7. **Dark Mode** - Deep, dark tones (↓↓ lightness)\n8. **Neon Electric** - Maximum saturation glow effect\n9. **Analogous Harmony** - Adjacent color wheel (+30° hue)\n10. **Warm Tones** - Shifted toward red/orange/yellow\n11. **Cool Tones** - Shifted toward blue/cyan\n\n## Key Features\n\n- 🖼️ **Bulk Image Upload** - Upload multiple images at once via drag-and-drop or file picker\n- 🎨 **11 Palette Variations** - Get diverse color schemes from a single image\n- 🌈 **OKLCH Format** - Modern color space with better perceptual uniformity\n- 📋 **Easy Copying** - Click any color to copy to clipboard\n- 💾 **Export Options** - Export all palettes as CSS variables\n- ✨ **Beautiful UI** - Modern, responsive design with smooth animations\n\n## Why OKLCH?\n\nOKLCH (Oklch color space) offers several advantages over traditional color formats like HSL:\n\n- ✅ Better perceptual uniformity than HSL\n- ✅ More colors than sRGB (supports P3, Rec2020)\n- ✅ No hue shift when changing chroma/lightness\n- ✅ Native CSS support in modern browsers\n- ✅ Predictable color transformations\n\n## Perfect For\n\n- 🎨 **Design Systems** - Generate comprehensive color palettes\n- 🖼️ **Brand Guidelines** - Extract colors from logo/images\n- 🌐 **Web Design** - Get instant theme variations\n- 📱 **App Development** - Create light/dark mode palettes\n- 🎭 **Accessibility** - Test contrast with monochrome palette\n\n## How It Works\n\nPalletto uses smart color extraction:\n\n1. **Downscales** images to ~150px for efficient processing\n2. **Extracts** unique colors with quantization (reduces near-duplicates)\n3. **Clusters** using k-means++ algorithm for optimal color grouping\n4. **Weights** colors by frequency for accurate representation\n5. **Transforms** into 11 variations by manipulating OKLCH components (Lightness, Chroma, Hue)\n\nExport your palettes as CSS custom properties ready to drop into any project:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Extracted Colors */\n  --primary-1: oklch(0.5 0.2 270);\n  --primary-2: oklch(0.6 0.15 330);\n  \n  /* Soft Pastels */\n  --soft-1: oklch(0.85 0.08 270);\n  \n  /* Complementary */\n  --inverted-1: oklch(0.5 0.2 90);\n  \n  /* ... all 11 palettes */\n}\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nBuilt with modern, performant technologies:\n\n- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server\n- **Culori** - Professional color conversion library with OKLCH support\n- **Vanilla JS** - No framework overhead, pure performance\n- **Canvas API** - Image processing and color extraction\n\n## Get Started\n\nVisit the live app at [languageseed.github.io/palletto](https://languageseed.github.io/palletto/) or run it locally:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/languageseed/palletto.git\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Start development server\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## 🙏 Credits\n\nPalletto is built on the excellent foundation of [oklch-picker](https://oklch.com/) by Evil Martians. Huge thanks to the original creators for their vision of making OKLCH color manipulation accessible and beautiful.\n\n## 🔗 Links\n\n- **Live App**: [languageseed.github.io/palletto](https://languageseed.github.io/palletto/)\n- **Repository**: [github.com/languageseed/palletto](https://github.com/languageseed/palletto)\n- **Original OKLCH Picker**: [oklch.com](https://oklch.com/)\n- **Report Issues**: [github.com/languageseed/palletto/issues](https://github.com/languageseed/palletto/issues)\n\n---\n\nWhether you're building a design system, extracting brand colors, or just exploring color theory, Palletto gives you the tools to work with colors in the most perceptually accurate way possible.

We're grateful to the 37signals team for their vision of beautiful, opinionated Linux environments.\n\nUbuntu is powerful, flexible, and free. But it has a reputation: too complex, too ugly, too much work to set up. [**Bentobox**](https://github.com/languageseed/bentobox) fixes that.\n\n> \"I made BentoBox to organize all of my build scripts and customization, and I find it useful—it saves me a lot of time. I'm not trying to build a company, I'm just sharing my knowledge and code in case it helps others.\" — Language Seed\n\nIt's a **one-command Ubuntu setup** that gives you a beautiful, fully-configured desktop in 30 minutes—whether you're a developer who needs to rebuild environments quickly, an everyday user looking for a Windows/Mac alternative, or someone who wants Linux as their primary OS while keeping Windows available when needed.\n\n## What is Bentobox?\n\nBentobox is a thoughtfully curated Ubuntu setup (forked from [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub)) that **eliminates rebuild friction** by streamlining dozens of Ubuntu customizations, configurations, package installations, and container deployments into a single automated process.\n\nThe name reflects our philosophy: like a Japanese bento box, we've carefully selected quality tools over quantity, each serving a specific purpose, arranged thoughtfully in a beautiful container.\n\n\u003Ccarousel>\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-1.png|Bentobox Desktop Interface|Beautiful curated Ubuntu desktop with modern wallpapers;\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-2.png|GUI Installer|Intuitive desktop installer for selecting applications and tools;\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-3.png|Theme Selection|Choose from multiple professionally curated themes;\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-4.png|Docker Integration|Portainer and OpenWebUI for container and AI management;\n/hello_world/images/2025-11-24-bentobox-5.png|Development Environment|Modern editors and development tools ready to use\n\u003C/carousel>\n\n## 🎯 Who Is This For?\n\nBentobox solves different problems for different people:\n\n### For Everyday Users: The Windows/Mac Alternative\n\n**Tired of Windows but intimidated by Linux?** Bentobox is Ubuntu made beautiful and approachable.\n\n**Perfect if you:**\n- Want to escape Windows bloat, telemetry, and forced updates\n- Can't afford a Mac or don't want vendor lock-in\n- Need a computer that just works and looks beautiful\n- Don't want to spend days learning terminal commands\n\n**You get:** Chrome, VLC media player, Obsidian for notes, LibreOffice, and a beautiful desktop with 60+ professional wallpapers. No technical knowledge required—the GUI installer walks you through everything.\n\n### For Developers: Eliminate Rebuild Friction\n\n**Tired of spending 2-3 days rebuilding dev environments?** Bentobox reduces it to 30 minutes.\n\n**Perfect if you:**\n- Need to rebuild/restore environments frequently\n- Want consistent setups across multiple machines\n- Value container-first development workflows\n- Need AI integration (OpenWebUI, optional Ollama)\n- Want to eliminate the \"fresh install tax\"\n\n**You get:** Docker + Portainer for visual container management, OpenWebUI for AI workflows, modern editors (VS Code, Neovim, Zed), and your choice of programming languages—all pre-configured and ready to use.\n\n### For Windows Migrants: Your Exit Strategy\n\n**Want Linux as your primary OS but still need Windows occasionally?**\n\n**Perfect if you:**\n- Want Linux benefits (privacy, control, performance) as your daily driver\n- Need Windows for specific apps (Adobe, gaming, specialized tools)\n- Don't want to commit 100% to Linux immediately\n- Prefer gradual migration with a safety net\n\n**You get:** Linux as your primary OS with optional **WinBoat** integration for running Windows apps when needed—or simply dual boot for gaming and Windows-exclusive software.\n\n## 🎮 What About Gaming?\n\n**Let's be honest:** If gaming is important to you, Linux has limitations. Some games don't work (anti-cheat issues), and performance can vary.\n\n**Our Recommendation: Dual Boot**\n\nMany Bentobox users run dual boot setups:\n- **Linux (Bentobox)** for development, work, browsing, and productivity\n- **Windows** for gaming, Adobe Creative Suite, and Windows-only apps\n\n**Best of both worlds, zero compromises.** Install Windows first, then Ubuntu + Bentobox on the remaining space. GRUB bootloader lets you choose at startup.\n\nFor Linux gaming compatibility, check [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) for your specific games.\n\n## ✨ What You Get\n\n### Everyone Gets\n\n- **Beautiful Desktop**: 60+ professionally curated wallpapers from Unsplash and Pexels\n- **Essential Apps**: Chrome browser, VLC media player, Obsidian notes, Flameshot screenshots\n- **Modern Interface**: Polished UI with thoughtful defaults\n- **GUI Installer**: No terminal required—select what you want with checkboxes\n- **Multiple Themes**: Choose from professionally curated color schemes\n\n### Developers Also Get\n\n- **Modern Editors**: VS Code, Neovim, Zed—all pre-configured\n- **Docker + Portainer**: Visual container management at `localhost:9000`\n- **OpenWebUI**: AI chat interface at `localhost:3000`\n- **Optional Ollama**: Local LLM server for privacy-focused AI development\n- **Programming Languages**: Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, Elixir, Rust, Java (your choice)\n- **Fast Rebuilds**: Machine dies? Back to full productivity in 30 minutes\n\n### Advanced Users Also Get\n\n- **Tailscale VPN**: Secure remote access to your environment\n- **WinBoat** (Optional): Run Windows apps seamlessly on Linux\n- **Barrier**: Keyboard/mouse sharing across multiple computers\n- **Extension System**: Add your own packages and themes with simple templates\n- **1Password, Sublime Text**: Professional tools available\n\n## 🚀 Installation\n\nIt's genuinely this simple—one command on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04+ system:\n\n```bash\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/languageseed/bentobox/master/boot-gui.sh | bash\n```\n\n**What happens next:**\n\n1. **GUI Launches**: A beautiful desktop interface appears (no terminal skills needed)\n2. **Make Your Choices**: Check boxes for what you want—apps, languages, themes\n3. **Automatic Installation**: Bentobox installs and configures everything (15-30 minutes)\n4. **Reboot**: Restart when prompted\n5. **Done**: Your complete environment is ready\n\n### After Installation\n\n**Access your tools:**\n- **Portainer**: `http://localhost:9000` (create admin account on first visit)\n- **OpenWebUI**: `http://localhost:3000`\n- **Ollama** (if installed): `http://localhost:11434`\n\n**Optional setup:**\n- **Download AI Models**: `docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.2`\n- **Connect Tailscale**: `sudo tailscale up`\n- **Configure WinBoat**: Launch from applications menu\n\n## 💡 Why Bentobox?\n\n### The Problems It Solves\n\n**1. Rebuild Friction**\n- Your machine dies or gets compromised → Panic and dread\n- Fresh Ubuntu install → Lose 2-3 days getting productive again\n- Can't replicate your setup → Each rebuild slightly different\n- Fear of rebuilding prevents fresh installs → System debt accumulates\n\n**Bentobox's Solution:** One command → 30 minutes → fully productive. It's insurance against catastrophe and freedom to experiment.\n\n**2. Windows/Mac Alternative**\n- Tired of Windows telemetry, bloat, and forced updates\n- Can't afford Mac's premium pricing\n- Want control over your computer\n- But intimidated by Linux's complexity\n\n**Bentobox's Solution:** Beautiful, approachable Ubuntu setup that just works. No technical knowledge required.\n\n**3. Development Environment Consistency**\n- Need same setup across multiple machines\n- Team onboarding takes days\n- Personal scripts are maintenance burden\n- Want container-first, AI-ready workflows\n\n**Bentobox's Solution:** Consistent, tested, community-maintained setup. Same environment everywhere.\n\n### Why Not Windows/Mac?\n\n**vs Windows:**\n- ✅ No telemetry tracking you\n- ✅ No forced updates during work\n- ✅ No bloatware\n- ✅ Faster on older hardware\n- ✅ Free forever\n- ✅ Full control over your system\n\n**vs Mac:**\n- ✅ Free (save $1000+)\n- ✅ Works on any hardware\n- ✅ Full customization control\n- ✅ Not locked to proprietary ecosystem\n\n**vs \"Plain Ubuntu\":**\n- ✅ No days of configuration\n- ✅ Beautiful by default\n- ✅ Everything pre-configured\n- ✅ But still customizable\n- ✅ 30 minutes vs 2-3 days\n\n### The Honest Trade-offs\n\n**Bentobox is perfect for:**\n- ✅ Developers needing reliable, fast rebuilds\n- ✅ Privacy-conscious users\n- ✅ Budget-conscious users (students, startups)\n- ✅ Office/productivity work\n- ✅ Linux-curious Windows users\n- ✅ Anyone valuing control over convenience\n\n**You'll want dual boot if:**\n- ⚠️ Gaming is important (keep Windows for that)\n- ⚠️ You need Adobe Creative Cloud regularly\n- ⚠️ Work requires specific Windows-only software\n\n**Bentobox isn't for:**\n- ❌ Hardcore gamers who only game (just use Windows)\n- ❌ Mac users happy in that ecosystem\n- ❌ People who love custom-building everything from scratch\n\n## 🛠️ Customization & Extensibility\n\nBentobox is designed to be your foundation, not your limitation.\n\n### Extension System\n\nWant to add applications or customize themes?

Formatting Tables\n\nPreview table layouts before adding to posts:\n\n| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Data | Data | Data |\n| Test | Preview | Perfect! |\n\n### 3. Testing Code Blocks\n\nSee how code appears:\n\n```python\ndef test_formatting():\n    \"\"\"Check if this looks good\"\"\"\n    return \"Perfect!\"\n```\n\n### 4. Quick Notes\n\nUse it as a scratchpad for ideas and notes that you might turn into blog posts later.\n\n---\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Basic Workflow\n\n1. **Open Merman:** Click the button on the blog index or visit `merman.html`\n2. **Paste/Type:** Add your markdown or Mermaid syntax\n3. **Preview:** See the rendered output instantly\n4. **Copy:** When it looks good, copy to your actual blog post\n\n### Example Session\n\n```markdown\n# Testing My Diagram\n\nLet me see if this works:\n\n\\`\\`\\`mermaid\ngraph TD\n    Start --> Middle\n    Middle --> End\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nLooks good! Now I'll add it to my blog post.\n```\n\n### Keyboard Tips\n\n- **Ctrl/Cmd + A:** Select all\n- **Ctrl/Cmd + C:** Copy selected text\n- **Tab:** Insert tab (for code indentation)\n\n---\n\n## Behind the Scenes\n\nMerman uses the same technology as your blog posts:\n\n- **Marked.js** - Markdown parsing\n- **Mermaid.js** - Diagram rendering\n- **localStorage** - Auto-save feature\n- **Same CSS** - Consistent styling with blog\n\nThis means what you see in Merman is **exactly** what you'll see in your blog posts!\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n### 1. Test Before Publishing\n\nAlways test complex diagrams in Merman first. It's faster than regenerating blog posts repeatedly.\n\n### 2. Use as Template Builder\n\nCreate diagram templates in Merman, then copy them to multiple posts.\n\n### 3. Share Diagrams\n\nNeed to share a diagram with someone? Create it in Merman, take a screenshot!\n\n### 4. Learning Tool\n\nExperimenting with Mermaid? Use Merman to learn syntax without affecting your blog.\n\n### 5. Draft Ideas\n\nWrite rough drafts in Merman, save them in localStorage, polish later.\n\n---\n\n## Comparison: Merman vs Blog Posts\n\n| Feature | Merman | Blog Posts |\n|---------|--------|------------|\n| **Speed** | Instant | Needs generation |\n| **Purpose** | Testing & drafting | Final publication |\n| **Editing** | Live typing | Markdown files |\n| **Preview** | Real-time | After generation |\n| **Persistence** | Browser localStorage | Git repository |\n| **Sharing** | Local only | Published online |\n\n**Use both together for the best workflow!** 🚀\n\n---\n\n## Access Merman\n\n**From blog index:** Click the \"🐠 Open Merman Scratchpad\" button\n\n**Direct link:** `merman.html`\n\n**Live URL:** [https://languageseed.github.io/hello_world/merman.html](https://languageseed.github.io/hello_world/merman.html)\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[Have Idea] --> B[Open Merman]\n    B --> C[Write/Paste Markdown]\n    C --> D[Preview Instantly]\n    D --> E{Good?}\n    E -->|No| C\n    E -->|Yes| F[Copy to content/my-post.md]\n    F --> G[Generate Blog Post]\n    G --> H[Deploy to GitHub]\n    H --> I[Live Blog!]\n    \n    style B fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff\n    style D fill:#10b981,color:#fff\n    style I fill:#f59e0b,color:#000\n```\n\n---\n\n## Why \"Merman\"?\n\nBecause it helps you navigate the sea of Markdown and Mermaid syntax! 🐠🌊\n\nPlus, it's a play on words:\n- **Mer**maid (diagrams)\n- **M**arkdown (formatting)\n- **Man** (your helper tool)\n\n= **Merman!** 🐠\n\n---\n\n## Start Using It Now!\n\n[Open Merman Scratchpad](../merman.html) and start experimenting!\n\nPerfect for:\n- 🧪 Testing new diagram types\n- 📝 Drafting blog content\n- 🎨 Experimenting with formatting\n- 🚀 Learning Mermaid syntax\n- ⚡ Quick previews\n\n---\n\n**Happy scripting!** ✨\n\n*Merman is your companion tool for creating amazing blog content faster and easier!*\n\n","5 min read",{"slug":31,"title":32,"author":5,"date":33,"excerpt":34,"content":35,"readingTime":36},"2025-11-12-getting-started","Getting Started with Language Seed Blog","November 12, 2025"," # Getting Started with Language Seed Blog  Welcome to my new blog!
