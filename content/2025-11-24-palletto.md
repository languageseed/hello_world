# Palletto: Extract Beautiful Color Palettes from Any Image

**Try it now: [languageseed.github.io/palletto](https://languageseed.github.io/palletto/)**

I'm excited to share [**Palletto**](https://github.com/languageseed/palletto), a powerful web app that transforms any image into 11 unique color palette variations using the modern OKLCH color space.

## What Makes Palletto Special?

Palletto is a fork of the excellent [oklch-picker](https://oklch.com/) by Evil Martians, enhanced with bulk image processing and an expanded palette generation system. Upload an image and instantly get 11 distinct color schemes ready to use in your design projects.

### 🎨 The 11 Palette Variations

Each image generates these unique palettes:

1. **Extracted Colors** - Original dominant colors from the image (k-means clustering)
2. **Soft Pastels** - Gentle, muted version (↑ lightness, ↓ chroma)
3. **Complementary** - Opposite colors (inverted lightness, +180° hue)
4. **Vibrant Bold** - Highly saturated, punchy colors (↑↑ chroma)
5. **Highlighter Neon** - Maximum possible chroma at optimal lightness (L=0.8)
6. **Monochrome** - Grayscale version (chroma = 0)
7. **Dark Mode** - Deep, dark tones (↓↓ lightness)
8. **Neon Electric** - Maximum saturation glow effect
9. **Analogous Harmony** - Adjacent color wheel (+30° hue)
10. **Warm Tones** - Shifted toward red/orange/yellow
11. **Cool Tones** - Shifted toward blue/cyan

## Key Features

- 🖼️ **Bulk Image Upload** - Upload multiple images at once via drag-and-drop or file picker
- 🎨 **11 Palette Variations** - Get diverse color schemes from a single image
- 🌈 **OKLCH Format** - Modern color space with better perceptual uniformity
- 📋 **Easy Copying** - Click any color to copy to clipboard
- 💾 **Export Options** - Export all palettes as CSS variables
- ✨ **Beautiful UI** - Modern, responsive design with smooth animations

## Why OKLCH?

OKLCH (Oklch color space) offers several advantages over traditional color formats like HSL:

- ✅ Better perceptual uniformity than HSL
- ✅ More colors than sRGB (supports P3, Rec2020)
- ✅ No hue shift when changing chroma/lightness
- ✅ Native CSS support in modern browsers
- ✅ Predictable color transformations

## Perfect For

- 🎨 **Design Systems** - Generate comprehensive color palettes
- 🖼️ **Brand Guidelines** - Extract colors from logo/images
- 🌐 **Web Design** - Get instant theme variations
- 📱 **App Development** - Create light/dark mode palettes
- 🎭 **Accessibility** - Test contrast with monochrome palette

## How It Works

Palletto uses smart color extraction:

1. **Downscales** images to ~150px for efficient processing
2. **Extracts** unique colors with quantization (reduces near-duplicates)
3. **Clusters** using k-means++ algorithm for optimal color grouping
4. **Weights** colors by frequency for accurate representation
5. **Transforms** into 11 variations by manipulating OKLCH components (Lightness, Chroma, Hue)

Export your palettes as CSS custom properties ready to drop into any project:

```css
:root {
  /* Extracted Colors */
  --primary-1: oklch(0.5 0.2 270);
  --primary-2: oklch(0.6 0.15 330);
  
  /* Soft Pastels */
  --soft-1: oklch(0.85 0.08 270);
  
  /* Complementary */
  --inverted-1: oklch(0.5 0.2 90);
  
  /* ... all 11 palettes */
}
```
